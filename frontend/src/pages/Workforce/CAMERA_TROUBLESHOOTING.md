### 2. ❌ "No Camera Device Found"

**Symptoms:**
- Error message: "No camera device found"
- Status shows "Camera hardware offline"
- Your computer/device has a camera but it's not detected

**Possible Causes & Fixes:**

| Cause | Solution |

| **Built-in camera disabled** | Check BIOS settings or Device Manager |
| **Camera driver missing** | Update device drivers in Device Manager |

| **Wrong port** | Try USB 2.0 vs USB 3.0 ports |

**Step-by-step fix for Windows:**
1. Right-click **Start Menu** → **Device Manager**
2. Expand **Cameras** section
3. If no cameras listed:
   - Expand **Other devices** and look for yellow ⚠️ icons

### 3. ❌ "Camera is in Use by Another Application"

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "Camera is busy" or "NotReadableError"
- Another app is using the camera

**Solution:**
1. Close all other applications using camera:
   - Zoom, Teams, Skype, Google Meet
   - OBS Studio, Streamlabs
   - Photo/Camera apps
   - Other browser tabs
2. Close your browser completely
3. Open the browser again
4. Navigate back to Face Attendance page

### 4. ❌ "Security Error" or HTTPS Warning

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "Camera blocked due to security"
- Page shows "http://" in address bar (not "https://")
- Mixed content warning in browser console

**Solution:**
Browsers require HTTPS (secure connection) for camera access, except on localhost.

| Scenario | Fix |
|----------|-----|
| **Local development** | Access via `http://localhost:3000` (not computer IP) |
| **Production server** | Ensure URL starts with `https://` |
| **Self-signed certificate** | Accept the certificate warning and proceed |
| **Mixed content** | Ensure all resources load over HTTPS |

   - Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Check "Cookies and cached images"
   - Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Check "Cookies" and "Cache"
   - Safari: History → Clear History → All time

2. **Reset permissions:**
   - Chrome: Settings → Site settings → Reset all permissions
   - Firefox: about:preferences → Privacy → Cookies and data → Manage Data

3. **Try incognito/private mode:**
   - Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+N
